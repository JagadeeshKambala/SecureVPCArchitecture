Logging, Monitoring, and Observability

1. Observability Goals
   The logging and monitoring strategy ensures:
   Visibility into API activity
   Visibility into network traffic
   Operational health monitoring
2. CloudTrail
   CloudTrail records all AWS management events across regions. Logs are stored securely and used for auditing and compliance.
3. VPC Flow Logs
   VPC Flow Logs capture accepted and rejected network traffic, enabling:
   Network troubleshooting
   Security analysis
   Incident investigation
4. CloudWatch Monitoring
   Default EC2 metrics provide insight into:
   CPU usage
   Network throughput
   Instance health
   CloudWatch alarms alert on abnormal behavior.
